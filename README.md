## Hermite Spline Kernels

This repository contains two notebook files.

Hermite\_Splines.ipynb shows how to computationally construct Hermite Spline Kernels, using numpy and pytorch.

Pytorch\_Hermite\_Splines.ipynb is a short reimplementation, entirely in pytorch (no numpy).

These notebooks were inspired by code originally written by Nils Wandel.
